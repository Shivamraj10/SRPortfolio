        Hey there! Iâ€™m Shivam Raj â€” a creative and detail-oriented Full Stack Developer with a strong passion for crafting clean, efficient, and user-focused digital experiences.

        I specialize in building dynamic, scalable, and interactive web applications using modern technologies like Java, JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, Express.js, and Tailwind CSS. My solid foundation in Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) fuels my problem-solving abilities and drives me to write optimized, maintainable code.

        ðŸŽ“ I'm currently pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science Engineering from Galgotias University, where I continue to enhance my technical and collaborative skills through academic and real-world projects.

        ðŸ’» So far, I've worked on a variety of impactful projects, including:

        â€¢ BookStore App - An interactive online bookstore with user authentication and cart features.
        â€¢ SmartGlass App - A role-based learning platform with smart dashboards.
        â€¢ Syncfusion Dashboard - A modern admin dashboard with charts, kanban, calendar, and responsive UI.
        Whether it's crafting sleek front-ends or engineering robust backends, I love transforming ideas into working software that makes a difference.
